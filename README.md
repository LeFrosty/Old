Hey! Welcome to my repository for LeagueSharp.

My assemblies are mostly made for personal use, but feel free to use them!
They might not be too advanced, but they fit my needs.

Some of the code I use is others' work, just edited a bit for my assembly, so all credit to them for those features.
I'm not really a coder, nor do I even know much about C#. I just learned some stuff from reading other assemblies and editing others' work to fit my needs.

Have fun and remember to upvote the assemblies on the L# Database if you like my work! :)
